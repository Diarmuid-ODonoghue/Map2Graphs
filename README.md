# Homomorphic Graph Search - HOGS

## 2 versions of the HOGS algorithm for Largest Common Edge Subgraph between 2 graphs
## Unlabeled or - with labels on edges and/or nodes.

Two versions of the graph mapping algorithm called HOGS - Homomorphic Graph Search.
Find the largest common edge subgraph, between two graphs.
Uses the Erdos Renyii graph generator.
Also: 3 versions of knowledge graphs derived from human Analogy experiments - **Analogy Materials Corpus**. 

Details forthcoming.
